## Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page

I decided to tackle this project first as I got really stuck with the previous project and will be coming back to that. While this is technically 'bigger', it's quite simple structurally so I thought if I can do this one first and get some better habits and take my time thinking through the CSS I will be in a better position to retry the previous project.
